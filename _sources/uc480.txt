Thorlabs' uc480 CCD/CMOS Cameras - :py:mod:`uc480`
==================================================

This module adds support for Thorlabs' uc480 CCD and CMOS cameras to python based on :py:mod:`ctypes`. This module has been tested on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 15.04.

Eample using :py:mod:`matplotlib` for displaying a captured image::

    import uc480
    import pylab as pl

    # create instance and connect to library
    cam = uc480.uc480()

    # connect to first available camera
    cam.connect()

    # take a single image
    img = cam.acquire()

    # clean up
    cam.disconnect()

    pl.imshow(img)
    pl.show()

**Changelog:**

*11-28-2016*:

    * Added bug fix and new functionality for connecting to camera through device ID instead of camera ID.

*01-07-2016*:

    * Added two new functions: `stop` and `get_sensor_size`.
